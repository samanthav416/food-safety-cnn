Fresh vs Stale Fruit Image Classification 

Have you ever wondered…
  If the fruit that’s been sitting around for a bit too long is safe to eat?
  If the fruit at the supermarket really does look funny?

Well, you wouldn’t be alone! 

“The biggest thing that affects the shelf life of the fruit is the type of fruit or vegetable itself, plus the time spent in the supply chain (storage, transport) from when it was picked. Some different families of fruits and vegetables simply just last longer, like potatoes, apples, carrots, garlic, lemons, and oranges. These varieties if stored correctly, can be eaten for up to a month or in some cases longer.” - [Source]

**Goal:** 

Using a dataset containing 14.7k images of fresh and stale fruit, build a convolutional neural network to determine whether a fruit can be safely eaten.

**Dataset Overview:**

Contains images of various fruits, sourced from Kaggle
  Consists of 14.7k images, categorized into fresh and stale classes.
  Each image is labeled with one of 12 classes representing different types of fruit and freshness.
